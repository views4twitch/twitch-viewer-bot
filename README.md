# twitch viewer bot
[Twitch view bot](https://views4twitch.com/)/twitch viewer kaufen is a service tool that aims to discover and increase visibility of talented and entry-level streamers who are trying to exist on Twitch, making great efforts to develop their channel. It is definitely not a malicious / Spam Tool. With respect to all veteran streamers who try to exist on Twitch or other platforms.

Viewer bots on Twitch can appear unrealistic and fake. Some other viewer bot services may require you to purchase total views in addition to the bot itself to make the viewership appear more legitimate and avoid detection by Twitch. However, as developers of Views4Twitch, we have created an artificial intelligence system that allows our bots to act like organic viewers. Our bots join streams at specific intervals and their participation does not show up as bot traffic in Twitch logs.

It's important to note that having an average of 75 viewers is only one of the many criteria for becoming a Twitch partner, and meeting this requirement alone does not guarantee partnership. Partnership is a separate process from being an "Affiliate," and there are other factors to consider. For more detailed information on this topic, you can refer to the guide on the User Forum. We are a service provider that offers tools to help you grow your channel, and we are not affiliated with Twitch or any other platform.
